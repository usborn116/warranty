Live version of this app at: https://warranties.fly.dev/users/sign_in

This application allows you to track you warranties! You will be able to filter by expiration, room where the item is used, filter for items with lifetime warranties, etc.

In the Items page, you can search for an item based on name, expiration status, and room that it's in. You can also add new items here:

The items page will show 3 columns: item details, a photo, and warranty details:

There are several fields to fill out when creating a new item:

Finally, the Rooms page will show you a list of rooms, the number of items in each room, and a list of items in that room. You can click on an item name to view it, and you can change the room name or delete it as well:
